OK. There are two kinds of tokens, <NEWLINE> and <OTHER>.
<NEWLINE> =~ /\n/
<OTHER> =~ /[^,\n]*/
Commas are not included in tokens; they are the equivalent of whitespace
in sane languages.
(This is because it's really a CSV format.)

I may refer to a token with a regexp.
This means a token that additionally matches that regexp.
Also, tokens may just be <NUMBER> or <INTEGER>,
which mean that they must be understandable numbers or integers
(to scanf, right now.)


<REST OF LINE> := <NEWLINE>
      	       | <IGNORE> <REST OF LINE>

<CONFIG FILE> := <REST OF LINE> <REST OF LINE> <CONFIG LINES>

<CONFIG LINE> := <IGNORE> <SHORTNAME> /v/ <PARAMETER> <REST OF LINE>
	      | <IGNORE> <SHORTNAME> /[fF]/ <FILENAME> <REST OF LINE>


Actually, the real issue is that the CSV format is a TERRIBLE idea for config files. Feel free to scrap it all and rewrite.
To heck with this.
