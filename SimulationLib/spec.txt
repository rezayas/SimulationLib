The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

A config file SHALL be a dictionary,
mapping keys (the internal names) to values.

Each value SHALL be a dictionary,
containing the key 'is_frame', which MUST have a boolean value,
and the key 'value' which is as follows:
If is_frame is false, then value MUST be a Parameter
(which shall be defined later)
otherwise value MUST be a DataFrame.

A DataFrame SHALL be a dictionary.
It MAY have only the key 'file',
in which case it SHOULD be treated as if the dictionary were replaced
with the contents of the file specified in the value.
More than one level of indirection in this manner MAY be treated as an error.

It MAY have the key 'loop_time', which MUST have a boolean value.
If there is no key 'loop_time',
it SHOULD be treated as if it existed and had the value FALSE.

It MAY have the keys
'age_bracket_size', 'age_bracket_count', and 'age_bracket_start'.
The first and third of these MUST have real values,
while the second MUST have an integer value.
'age_bracket_size' and 'age_bracket_count' MUST be positive.
'age_bracket_start' MAY be any real number,
but negative numbers make little sense.
It MUST NOT have any number of these keys besides 0 or 3.

It MAY have the keys 'time_bracket_size', 'time_bracket_count',
and 'time_bracket_start', subject to the same restrictions as for
their 'age_bracket_*' counterparts, except that they MUST exist if
'loop_time' has the value TRUE.

It MAY have the key 'ignore_gender', which SHALL have a boolean value.
If this key does not exist, it SHOULD be treated as if it had the
value FALSE.

It SHALL have the key 'values',
whose value MUST be a list, each of whose elements MUST be a
dictionary D,
containing the keys 'age_bracket' 'time_bracket', 'is_female', and
'value'.

If in the DataFrame the keys 'age_bracket_*' do not exist,
in its values the key 'age_bracket' SHALL be optional,
and MUST be ignored if it is used.

If in the DataFrame the keys 'time_bracket_*' do not exist,
in its values the key 'time_bracket' SHALL be optional,
and MUST be ignored if it is used.

If in the DataFrame the key 'ignore_gender' has the value TRUE,
in its values the key 'is_female' SHALL be optional,
and MUST be ignored if it is used.

The key 'age_bracket' SHALL have value an integer between 0 and the
containing DataFrame's 'age_bracket_count' (inclusive on the low,
exclusive on the high.)

The key 'time_bracket' SHALL have value an integer between 0 and the
containing DataFrame's 'time_bracket_count' (inclusive on the low,
exclusive on the high.)

The key 'is_female' SHALL have value a boolean.

The key 'value' SHALL have value a Parameter.

----

Parameters:

A Parameter SHALL be either a real number or a dictionary.
If it is a dictionary, it SHALL have the key 'distribution'.

It MAY additionally have the key 'configure', which SHALL be a
boolean, treated as FALSE if absent.
It MAY have the keys 'min' and 'max', which SHALL be reals.

The key 'distribution' shall have a string value,
which shall be the name of a distribution.

It SHALL have additional keys with names those of the non-optional parameters
of the distribution, and MAY have keys with names those of the
optional parameters. If an optional parameter is absent, it SHALL be
treated as if it had its default value.

Following is a table of distribution names and parameters thereof.
