TIMEBSIZE and TIMEBCOUNT are - here, so they are ignored and all lines with Time are blank
All Parameters here are a number, but they could also be in format: DISTNAME,REMINDER,PAR1,PAR2,PAR3,PAR4,CALINC,SCOPE,MIN,MAX.

The first two lines describe the rest of the data, with AGEBSIZE = ageBracketSize, or approximately what age range a perosn fits into. AGEBCOUNT describes the number of age ranges present in this set of data
For example, this set of data contains AGEBCOUNT=4 age ranges (3 - 4.2, 4.2 - 5.4, 5.4 - 6.6, 6.6 - 7.8)
